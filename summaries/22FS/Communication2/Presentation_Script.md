# Presentation Script

Welcome to my presentation about 5G's adaptive antennas.

Today, nearly everybody has a cellphone. Using it in public to browse social media sites, like Twitter and Facebook, or watch a Video on Netflix or YouTube, is socially accepted and a common occurence. 

Because of this increase in usage of cellular data, new standards were developed. From 2G to 3G, which allowed mobile users to browse the internet with acceptable loading times, to 4G, with which, the populous could watch videos on the go. The most recent standard is 5G, which boasts up to 10Gbit/s in an optimal situation. *(TODO: reference the poster)*

With the need for more speed, data through-put and broader coverage, its tempting to let the let the antennas send with more power. The maximum allowed electromagnetic radition is limited by the goverments around the world to keep their citizens safe.

To allow the antennas to send with more power while still keeping the people safe, adaptive antennas can be used, to only send radiation to the device instead of all directions from the antenna. This reduces the electromagnetic radiation levels and enables companies operating their antennas at a higher power level but with similar radiation levels resulting in better coverage, higher data rates and improved energy efficency. 

However, in Switzerland the law did not distinguish between "normal" antennas and adaptive antennas. To remedy this, the swiss goverment instructed the BAFU to research adaptive antennas and find a correction factor which can be applied to the power level of an antenna. This would enable the antenna to send at a higher power level as the actual power level is corrected to a lower level.
