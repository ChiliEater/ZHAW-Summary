Hi, 

Having access to the internet is vital for any modern society. With its vast storage of knowledge, it is a blessing for learning new things. For what you needed, a cooperation with financial backing, can be done by a teenager from his bedroom. It can bring different people together to fight in a bigger war and help companies turn a profit.

But still, countless people have no or poor access to the internet. In America, a country with a relative high standard of living, 19 million people [1] still don't have broadband internet and those people mostly live in rural areas. Looking at the world population, the numbers look even worst. ITU estimates that in the world, only 38% in rural areas are able to go online, almost half that who live in urban houses [2].

But this makes perfect sense. Building out the necessary infrastructure is a costly endevour and companies like a return on their investment. In big cities with a lot of customers, this is a fairly easy task, but tunneling an optical fiber for a couple of people on a remote settlement isn't cost-effective. For this reason, many people have to make due with just slow and expensive satellite internet.

Our solution is to use low orbit satellites to provide fast, reliable and cheap internet to the masses. Because we use satellites, we don't have to build any large and costly structures on the ground from which only a few people can benefit. Instead, we'll launch a network of satellites which can provide internet to 7 billion people.

You might ask, how this satellite internet differs from the previously mentioned slow and expensive ones. For one, we use satellites in low orbit. This brings the benefitÂ  that the connections can be much faster and more reliable due to the lower distance to the earth. 

Mr. Thalmann will now tell you more about our ground braking technology.

We also use state-of-the-art technology in our satellites and antennas, like beam forming the signals to more easily reach the satellite from the antenna and waste less energy blasting unnecessary radiation in the sky.

All this means is that you can buy an antenna, place it anywhere where it has unobstructed view of the sky and browse the World Wide Web to your heart's content.
